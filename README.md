👋 Hi, I’m @pspears

👀 I’m interested in ...

Delphi, T-SQL, 3D printing, music, and a bunch of stuff that isn't relevant here.

🌱 I’m currently learning about 3D printing, having built my own Anet A8 from kit and upgraded it over the years. 
There are also a whole bunch of new features that have opened up in recent Delphi releases, which I'm excited to 
be on board with.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- My MPDelta project - a mostly-printed delta 3D printer, inspired by the MPCNC design.
- Delphi PoC's, using Delphi 10.4. I would have loved to have used Lazarus, but for its lacking support for anonymous methods.
- A home budgeting application. The plan is to write this in Delphi with SQL Server. Then I'll port it over to SQLite, and possibly FireMonkey. In that order. This is based on a complex Excel file I currently use to do my budgeting, which works very well, but could be improved upon, so it is based on a proven principle.
